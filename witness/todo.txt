In vague order of importance.

- Editor improvements
-- By hand interaction regions
-- Validate button
--- Improved solution display, leveraging trace code
-- Mark methods as private
-- Pillar button (and symmetry buttons, disabled)
- Search for fixme/todo and move them here
-- Move generate out of engine?
-- Fix generation colors
-- Add missing daily styles
- Some way to pass data.puzzle into window.showHint -- maybe move hint logic into tracing?
-- Or, stop cloning the puzzle in trace(), and just clear the grid instead
- Solution draw with native tracing
- change all divs to auto-centering? It's all I seem to use them for rn
- Zero size polys fail when zero-size negas don't
- Multi start/end
- Dots & gaps into the grid
- Symmetry
- Colored Symmetry -> Probably want line color 0/1/2 instead of true/false
- Colored Dots
- Server / full release
-- Shortnames for puzzles
-- A whole bunch of UI for browsing puzzles
-- Signin?
-- Preview images for puzzles (meta:og tag)
-- Name for the project (so I can have a reasonable dns name)
- Region to include edges
-- Dots cancelled by negation
-- Polyominos will not allow trace-through
- Flash for errors (Invisible Dots)
