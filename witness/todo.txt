In vague order of importance.

- Dots are rendering under start/end
- Show hint is adding endpoints in pillars?
- End point is pushed into second-to-right when squishing pillars
- Solve with pillars is slow, maybe increase warning threshold / disable in play mode?
- Maybe remove show solution for play mode entirely?
- Show hint is adding endpoints in pillars?
- Start point interaction region is still active in editor
- Bug with negation, see tests
- Pillars are failing, see tests
- Hints are bad for triangles w/ pillars?
- Shape Chooser is bad for small puzzles, set minimum size?
- Move generate, etc out of engine? Probably need a new folder for 'legacy' anyways.
- Fix generation colors
- Add missing daily styles
- Rewrite polyfit to use region[0] aka int version
- Solver compatibility with mid-segment start
- Solution draw with mid-segment start
- Mid-segment endpoints
- Multi start/end
- Dots & gaps into the grid
-- Empty segments (not just gaps)
- Symmetry
!- Stable release
- Server
-- Shortnames for puzzles
-- A whole bunch of UI for browsing puzzles
-- Signin?
-- Preview images for puzzles (meta:og tag)
-- Name for the project (so I can have a reasonable dns name)
- Region to include edges
-- Dots cancelled by negation
-- Polyominos will not allow trace-through
- Flash for errors (Invisible Dots)
- Colored Symmetry -> Probably want line color 0/1/2 instead of true/false
- Colored Dots
!- Feature complete

!- Small things / Bugs
- Zero size polys fail when zero-size negas don't
- change all divs to auto-centering? It's all I seem to use them for rn
-- Maybe have a class="centered"
- Search for fixme/todo and move them here
- When start == end, can't enter end without leaving the cell

!- Won't Fix
- Tracing over gaps is possible if you go too fast
