Bug fixes:
- Puzzle name isn't reset on new
- Custom color is probably not worth it for a 4x4
- Import into solver ("Play") // New-Load-Delete-Import-Export-Play
- Buttons should be tds, so that background can highlight (pseudo-border)
- Disable auto-validation, allow larger puzzle sizes
- Windmill Import instead of export?
- Zero size polys fail when zero-size negas don't


Features:
- Multi start
- Multi end
- Symmetry
- Colored Symmetry
- Colored Dots
- Invisible Dots (flash for errors)
- Dots cancelled by negation

Consider:
- Custom button images
- Make poly only prompt for shape on second click
