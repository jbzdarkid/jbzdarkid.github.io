In vague order of importance.

- Flash for errors
- Some cleanup needed for _polyFit
-- Polyominos will not allow trace-through
-- Rewrite polyfit to use region[0] aka int version -- May not be possible, how do you encode -2?
- Fix generation colors
- Improve tracing for 1xN
-- Some of it is endpoint handling -- it's preventing outer wall sliding even when endpoint is in another direction
- Mid-segment start
-- Solution tracer compatibility
- Mid-segment endpoints
- Simple Symmetry (horiz/verti)
!- Stable release
- Rich line data
-- Dots & gaps into the grid
-- Dots cancelled by negation
-- Start & end into the grid?
-- Empty segments (not just gaps)
-- Colored symmetry lines (0/1/2)
-- Colored Dots
-- Clean up solution to be a full path (start point = none, same as trace)
- Hide solution (puzzleData) from global scope
- Server
-- Shortnames for puzzles
-- A whole bunch of UI for browsing puzzles
-- Signin?
-- Preview images for puzzles (meta:og tag)
-- Name for the project (so I can have a reasonable dns name)
- Invisible Dots
!- Feature complete!

!- Small things / Bugs
- What uses getRotations? Why do we need rot=null?
- Solve with pillars is slow, maybe increase warning threshold / disable in play mode?
- Maybe remove show solution for play mode entirely?
- Move generate, etc out of engine? Probably need a new folder for 'legacy' anyways.
- Add missing daily styles
- Shape chooser is not centered
- change all divs to auto-centering? It's all I seem to use them for rn
-- Maybe have a class="centered"
- Search for fixme/todo and move them here
- transform: scale(2) doesn't work on safari?
