In vague order of importance.

- Move sensitivity into the loadSettings function (add an expandable box?)
- Optimization: Scan entire grid before regions, check for overridden gaps (fail), missing dots + no negation symbols. If no symbols at all, skip region check.
- Hex over startpoint is not bubbling through the click event
-- No obvious way to pass through (it's a baked SVG)
-- No obvious way to change layering (would need a new SVG object to be inserted at the end, invisibly)
-- Maybe make hex.onclick = start.onclick?
- Start-grow animation
- What is .line in animations doing?
- Name the tests (i.e. change array to dictionary)
- Fix generation colors
- Improve tracing for 1xN
-- Some of it is endpoint handling -- it's preventing outer wall sliding even when endpoint is in another direction
- Simple Symmetry (horiz/verti)
!- Stable release
- Favicon
- Rich line data
-- Dots & gaps into the grid
-- Dots cancelled by negation
-- Start & end into the grid?
-- Empty segments (not just gaps)
-- Colored symmetry lines (0/1/2)
-- Colored Dots
-- Mid-segment start
--- Solution tracer compatibility
-- Mid-segment endpoints
-- Clean up solution to be a full path (start point = none, same as trace)
- Hide solution (puzzleData) from global scope
- Server
-- Shortnames for puzzles
-- A whole bunch of UI for browsing puzzles
-- Signin?
-- Preview images for puzzles (meta:og tag)
-- Name for the project (so I can have a reasonable dns name)
-- Telemetry
- Invisible Dots
!- Feature complete!

!- Small things / Bugs
- What uses getRotations? Why do we need rot=null?
- Solve with pillars is slow, maybe increase warning threshold / disable in play mode?
- Maybe remove show solution for play mode entirely?
- Move generate, etc out of engine? Probably need a new folder for 'legacy' anyways.
- Add missing daily styles
- Shape chooser is not centered
- change all divs to auto-centering? It's all I seem to use them for rn
-- Maybe have a class="centered"
- Search for fixme/todo and move them here
- transform: scale(2) doesn't work on safari?
