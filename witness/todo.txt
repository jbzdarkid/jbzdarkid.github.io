In vague order of importance.

- Solve with pillars is slow, maybe increase warning threshold / disable in play mode?
- Maybe remove show solution for play mode entirely?
- Some cleanup needed for _polyFit
-- Merge 2 functions into 1?
-- Rewrite polyfit to use region[0] aka int version
-- Fix failing test case for 0x0 poly
- Move generate, etc out of engine? Probably need a new folder for 'legacy' anyways.
- Fix generation colors
- Improve tracing for 1xN
- Add missing daily styles
- Shape chooser is not centered
- Mid-segment start
-- Solution tracer compatibility
- Mid-segment endpoints
- Region includes edges, update validation
-- Dots cancelled by negation
-- Polyominos will not allow trace-through
- Multi end
- Rich line data
-- Dots & gaps into the grid
-- Empty segments (not just gaps)
-- Colored symmetry lines (0/1/2)
-- Colored Dots
-- Clean up solution to be a full path (start point = none, same as trace)
- Symmetry
!- Stable release
- Hide solution (puzzleData) from global scope
- Server
-- Shortnames for puzzles
-- A whole bunch of UI for browsing puzzles
-- Signin?
-- Preview images for puzzles (meta:og tag)
-- Name for the project (so I can have a reasonable dns name)
- Flash for errors (Invisible Dots)
!- Feature complete

!- Small things / Bugs
- change all divs to auto-centering? It's all I seem to use them for rn
-- Maybe have a class="centered"
- Search for fixme/todo and move them here
- When start == end, can't enter end without leaving the cell
